## Overview

I created a simple QR code component using html and css. By using modern css, I was able to come to a finished project.

### Screenshot

## My process

I built the QR code component mobile screen first and limiting the width of the whole component to 375px.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to use the css property of width. I also learned about proper nesting of html elements.

I am proud of the css snippet below:

```css
.container {
  margin: 3em 0;
  padding: 1em 0;
  max-width: 375px;
  margin-inline: auto;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 20px;
```

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about css flex and css grid. I would also like to learn about Javascript DOM.
